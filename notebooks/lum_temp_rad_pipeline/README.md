# Global X-ray properties

## XMM analysis

The 'running_LTR_pipeline.ipynb' notebook contains the global XMM analysis of these groups - particularly the luminosity-temperature-radius pipeline run, which iteratively measures temperatures from XMM spectra, and from an assumed mass-temperature relation converts each measurement into a new radius estimate.

## Chandra analysis

Some of the groups also have Chandra observations, and we attempt to perform a complementary analysis (using XMM-measured radii) of their spectra to act as another point of comparison. For expediency, there are four notebooks - for the R500, R500 from frozen temperature mode, R2500, and R2500 from frozen temperature mode. The code is essentially identical, and ideally this replication will not be the final form.
